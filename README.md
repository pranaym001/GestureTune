# GestureTune
Hand Gesture Control for Volume and Brightness This project enables control of system volume and screen brightness through hand gestures using Python and MediaPipe. By detecting the distance between your thumb and index finger, the program adjusts your screen's brightness and system volume smoothly.

Features Left Hand Gesture: Controls screen brightness based on the distance between the thumb and index finger.

Right Hand Gesture: Controls system volume with the same gesture.

Smooth transitions in both brightness and volume adjustments.

Real-time hand detection using MediaPipe for precise control.

pycaw for system volume control.

screen_brightness_control for screen brightness management.

Technologies Used Python

OpenCV: For image and video processing.

MediaPipe: For hand tracking.

pycaw: For controlling the system's audio volume.

screen_brightness_control: For adjusting screen brightness.

NumPy: For data handling and smooth calculations.
